      <p>That guy in the picture is me, Seth Wisniewski. There isn't a whole lot to know about me. Ever since I was younger, I've loved the idea of creating. Films, images, music, I've dabbled in it all.</p>
      <p>I was born in London Ontario, and have resided in the hamlet known as Port Franks for the entirety of my life. I am told that I'm easy to get along with, and I love my passions to the moon.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in working with me, shoot me an email or find me on my social medias so that we can get in touch!</p>
